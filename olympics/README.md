## Olympics engine

Here lies the underlying physics engine for the running environment, including the collision detection and response, map generation and pygame visualisation.

To play a game, run the *main.py* file or execute:

> python main.py


### Partial observation

In every map, agents can only see object in front of him, this includes the bouncable wall, crossable arrow, opponent agents and the Final.

The observation is a 25*25 array shown as below:

|     1        | agent green  |
|     4        |    arrow     |
|     5        | agent purple |
|     6        |    wall      |
